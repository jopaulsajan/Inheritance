# Inheritance
Blood type inheritance is determined by two alleles: A, B, or O. Each parent passes one allele to their child, resulting in combinations like OO, AO, AB, and more. This program, in `inheritance.c`, simulates the inheritance of blood types across generations, demonstrating how genetic patterns shape family blood types.
